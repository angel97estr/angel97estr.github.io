### CPSC 120

* Lab 1
    What I liked about Lab 1 was that I was able to learn the basics of coding through Git operations. I was also introduced to the terminal and how to use VScode. One of the repositories that I learned was the git clone command which enables me to download code from GitHub onto my own computer.

* Lab 8
    What I liked about Lab 8 was that in part 1 we were able to create a program where we could make a sandwich with certain ingredients. I liked how we were able to apply spring as well as vectors. I learned to use these operations in order to specify the ingredients of a sandwich which would then produce a single line describing said sandwich.

* Lab 11
    What I liked about Lab 11 was that it showed me how to make a game through coding. I was also able to learn how to create a random number generator through arguments and if statements. The program was able to pick a number between 1 and 10 and I would try and guess it through various hints.
